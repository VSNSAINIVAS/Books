# Books
Developed a basic spring boot application and pushed the images to the docker repo.

Steps to follow to spawn the containers locally and perform CRUD operations on the book table of the Books database.

## Steps
1) Clone the git repository using ``` bash git clone https://github.com/VSNSAINIVAS/Books.git```.
2) Make sure minikube and kubectl are install by using commands ```bash minikube version``` & ```bash kubectl version```.
3) Start the minikube by using ```bash minikube start --driver=<driver_name>``` (Driver name should be replaced by name of the driver examples : docker, hyperv etc.)
